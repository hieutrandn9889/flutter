## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter driver and we have discussed a lot about BDD with Flutter driver with flutter_gherkin as well

A few resources used in this project project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
- [Flutter Driver: Flutter driver API](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_driver/FlutterDriver-class.html)
- [Flutter Gherkin: Gherkin + Runner for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gherkin#-readme-tab-)

For help getting started with Flutter driver, view our 
[ExecuteAutomation YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/executeautomation), which offers free tutorials, 
samples, guidance on flutter driver along with BDD style coding practice.
